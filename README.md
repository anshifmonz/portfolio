# WebDev-Starter-Kit

Welcome to my WebDev Starter Kit repository! This is where I share my journey into front-end development as part of my full stack development path. Having recently learned HTML and CSS, I embarked on creating these simple projects to solidify my understanding and explore various web development concepts.

## What's Inside?

This repository houses a collection of beginner-friendly projects that range from basic web pages to more intricate layouts and styles. Each project represents a stepping stone in my learning process, offering practical examples of HTML structure, CSS styling techniques, and responsive design principles.
